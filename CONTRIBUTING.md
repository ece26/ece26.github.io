## Contributing the project

If you want to make a contribution, please fork this repository and then make a PR once you have changes that you'd like to offer. The moderation team will look through at our earliest convenience and then either accept or deny the changes. In order to make sure that your PR is accepted on the first go through, please try to follow the list of stipulations below.

## Recommendations

- Try to keep your changes short (preferably just one or two features at any given point in time)
- Make sure that your changes don't contain obviously offensive content (I'm not going to waste your time with a long-winded, obvious lecture on wokeness. Just make sure you're not a dick.)
- Be as clear as you can when describing the changes that you made in the commit message. 

Overall, thank you for your interest in contributing the ece26.github.io. We thoroughly appreciate it.
