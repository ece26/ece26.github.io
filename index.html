        <h1>A note on "Kill All Men" or KAM.</h1>
        <p>
        Upon hearing the words "kill all men", the reaction for many people is to
        assume that the remark is a blatant invitation for a male removal rivalling
        that of the Cambodian or Rwandan genocide. Often, the next remark is to invite
        that this statement is equivalent in context and meaning to the
        conceptualization of a mass killing of women, in perpetuity, throughout the
        universe.

        Beginning with the obvious, saying "kill all men", "kill all women", or "kill
        all {insert gender group}" is plainly unpleasant. None of those are things that
        genuine, mature, and non-hateful people would say in any context that evoked
        any sense of seriousness. If you will indulge my thinking, I would argue that
        seriousness has become a rare quality in a world that has left so many grasping
        for post-modernism to cure themselves of the future that is the harbinger of
        their destruction. What was previously unfeasible to be uttered in a social
        situation is now considered common usage. Further than that, the conversation
        of why statements have a contextual meaning is commonly neglected, as to speed
        up conversation in the age of information.  The unfortunate conclusion is that
        many will take something that should be interpreted as nothing more than an
        expression of distaste at being one of the down-trodden as the implication that
        they must fight to exist. 

        The phrase "kill all women" is obviously morally flawed to highest degree. The
        core sentiment behind them is that of indiscriminate hatred and murder of
        people for no greater reason than an arbitrary piece of identity. Regardless of
        any common definition for what constitutes a justification for murder, the
        suggestion of murdering women for being who they are is nothing short of the
        most grievous of such.  It follows that since there is fundamentally no
        difference in terms of men, women, or other gender groups having a right to
        exist, that the actual fundamental statement "kill all men" is nothing short of
        horrendous. 

        With that cleared up, it is important to understand the context and meaning of
        the statement. While we might accept statements like "I am starving" or "I
        would kill for a bicycle like that", we do not fundamentally mean what those
        statements mean. As humans use so called "natural language" rather than a fixed
        syntax like that of Common Lisp, there is always interpretation up to whatever
        the meaning of any given instance of natural language is used.  In the instance
        of starving, rarely do we actually mean we are starving. If upon saying that,
        people rushed to find food for you to prevent a death of malnutrition, the
        words would hold a different weight. The words are meant to express a sense of
        hunger in the superlative, since sometimes it is not enough to simply say one
        is hungry.  There is not fundamental reason to consider this to be a bad thing
        to say; it merely exposes the faults in the English language if the majority of
        users opt to use terminology that has many "name collisions". 

        To relate more clearly with the perceived meaning of "kill all men", take the
        second statement: "I would kill for a bicycle like that". Surely a perfectly
        literal world would take great offense to the concept that someone would
        another for a bicycle comprised out of metal, rubber, and a handful of other
        materials. The total cost of such bicycle could not exceed what even the least
        expensive human purchased in a human trafficking operation could command.
        Further, no human has a worth that is less than any material object by virtue
        of existing. Reasonable people can tell that the person expressing their
        perceived desire to murder is simply an expression of desire for a bicycle
        rather than a desire to kill. Understandably, that is not very different from
        the suggestion to kill all men. It is a statement that is literally
        intolerable, but perceptibly casual. 

        An incredibly important distinction is that:
        <ul>
        <li> There is no reason for anyone to suspect that someone uttering "I am starving" is actually starving; that is the reason it is acceptable in conversation.</li>
        <li> There is no reason for anyone to suspect that someone uttering "I would kill for a bicycle like that" actually intends on murdering for a bicycle of that pedigree. Likewise, that is why it is acceptable in conversation. </li>
        </ul>

        The phrase "kill all men", in normal conversation with sane people, a joke. It
        is an expression of those angry at the patriarchy that has persisted for all of
        human civilization and has impacted everything that those who are not men say,
        do, believe, or feel. Note the anger being expressed as "kill" and the
        patriarchy being expressed as "all men". If the statement were simply "I would
        like to kill my neighbour because he is a man", then that would simply be
        misandrist implication of murder. The phrase "all men" paradoxically means
        every man and no man simultaneously. In a joking instance, it is a way to spice
        up the phrase "death to the patriarchy", which implies that the ideas behind
        male supremacy must die off. Surely, a reasonable person could see that "death
        to the patriarchy" means nothing more than an ideological war on hatred towards
        women. 

        The reason that the phrase "kill all women" is considered entirely and
        obviously unacceptable is that there is a long history of men murdering women.
        While women certainly do murder men for no reason other than them being men,
        the quantity is such that there are few men who have had to live in fear of
        women. To those men: it is perfectly acceptable if you find the statement "kill
        all men" to remind you of that fear. As you are a human deserving of respect,
        you have to say nothing more than "I feel uncomfortable with that". Those who
        push further are intolerable people regardless of whether they condone saying
        such a thing. On the other hand, there is a context for women to suspect that a
        man saying "kill all women" does actually intend on killing women. This is a
        subject already well documented by many scholars and agencies. I will add some
        pieces of information down below if that claim is one that is difficult to
        accept.

        It might be hard to hear, but there is a context behind why people act the way
        they act.
